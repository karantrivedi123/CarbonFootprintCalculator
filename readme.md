# Portfolio Carbon Footprint Calculator

**[Live App Demo Link - You will add this later]**

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is an interactive web application that calculates the carbon footprint of an investment portfolio. It addresses the real-world challenge of incomplete ESG data by using a machine learning model to estimate carbon emissions for companies that do not report them.

This tool allows an investor to upload their portfolio and receive an immediate, data-driven estimate of their "financed emissions" in tons of CO‚ÇÇe.
